# Orange & Grey Online Resume using Materializecss

This portfolio is built to replace my old wordpress site. It is my first attempt to built my own website after a long time effort of learning how to build one. I built this using [Materializecss](http://materializecss.com), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com), and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Yeah, I opt the hardway :) but it's well worth the experience I gained.

Why orange & grey? actually there are 3 colors here instead of 3 (orange, dark blue and grey). Well, I came from construction & mining industry, they are the color of uniforms we used to wear in our daily activities.

## Features

* It has a landing page with slide show in the background (all pictures thanks to https://gratisography.com)
* Fully responsive
* [Materialize](http://materializecss.com) design
* [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)
* Smooth scrolling
* [Formspree](http://formspree.io) to submit the email (I'm not ready for the back-end yet, sorry)
* Thanks to [DevTips YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/devtipsfordesigners) for inspiring me how to make those dynamic bullets in the Skill section.


## TODO
* I'd like to be able to change the color theme. Need to learn it first :) .
* Create back-end to send email. PHP?
* Auto resize the 1st card size in the Work section so all cards look nice in their container, the current state doesn't. I need to find it how in SASS.
* Print to PDF

## How to install/use

All you need to do is download it [here](https://github.com/thegreyside/thegreyside.github.io), click the "Download ZIP" button. Then extract to your hosting service.

You need to edit 4 files to fit your needs, they are `index.html`, `portfolio/index.html` `css/home.css` and `css/portfolio.css`. 

***There is also the Jekyll/SASS version of this theme if you prefer that one, grab it [here](https://github.com/thegreyside/materializecss_online_resume_jekyll)*** With that in hand, you only need to edit the `portfolio.yml` and `settings.yml` to change the content. It's pretty straight forward.
