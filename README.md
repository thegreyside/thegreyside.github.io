# Orange & Grey Online Resume using Materializecss

This online resume is built to replace my old wordpress site. I built this using [Materializecss](http://materializecss.com), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com), and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 

Why orange & grey? actually there are 3 colors here instead of 3 (orange, dark blue and grey). Well, I came from construction & mining industry, they are the color of uniforms we used to wear in our daily activities.

## TODO
* I'd like to be able to change the color theme. Need to learn it first :) .
* Create back-end to send email. PHP?
* Auto resize the 1st card size in the Work section so all cards look nice in their container, the current state doesn't. I need to find it how in SASS.
* Print to PDF

## How to install/use

All you need to do is download it [here](https://github.com/thegreyside/thegreyside.github.io), click the "Download ZIP" button. Then extract to your hosting service.

You have to edit 2 files to change the content according to your needs, they are `index.html`, `resume/index.html`. 

**There is also the Jekyll/SASS version of this theme if you prefer that one, grab it [here](https://github.com/thegreyside/materializecss_online_resume_jekyll)**. With that you only need to edit the `resume.yml` and `settings.yml` to change the content. It's pretty straight forward.
