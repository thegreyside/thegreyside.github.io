# Orange & Grey Online Resume using Materializecss

This a static online resume is built to replace my old wordpress site. I built this using [Materializecss](http://materializecss.com), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com), and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 

Why orange & grey? actually there are 3 colors here instead of 3 (orange, dark blue and grey). Well, I came from construction & mining industry, they are the color of uniforms we used to wear in our daily activities.

## TODO
* I'd like to be able to change the color theme. Need to learn it first :) .
* Beautify the navbar for mobile.
* Create back-end to send email. PHP?
* Print to PDF

## How to install/use

All you need to do is download it [here](https://github.com/thegreyside/thegreyside.github.io), click the "Download ZIP" button. Then extract them to your hosting service.

**Note #1:** You have to edit 2 files to change the content according to your needs, they are `index.html` and `resume/index.html`.
**Note #2:** And you need to replace the photos in `/img` folder with your photos. Just rename the files so they match what was there.
**Note #3:** There are 2 pictures unavailable, yet and I put a placeholder there. But, if you have all the assets in your hand just replace them all with yours.

**There is also the Jekyll/SASS version of this theme if you prefer that one, grab it [here](https://github.com/thegreyside/materializecss_online_resume_jekyll)**. With that you only need to edit the `resume.yml` and `settings.yml` to change the content. It's pretty straight forward.
